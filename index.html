This powerful dua calls upon Allah ﷻ — by His Names Al-Hayy (The Ever-Living) and Al-Qayyūm (The Self-Sustaining) — to transform every sin from our past, present, and future into abundant good deeds, magnified beyond measure by His infinite mercy.

*The Duʿāʾ:*  

Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Hayy (O Ever-Living), Ya Qayyum (O Self-Sustaining), Bi-Rahmatika (By Your Mercy), we ask of You a special forgiveness that transforms every one of our sins from past, present and future into abundant Ḥasanāt (good deeds). And have those Ḥasanāt magnified and enlarged infinitely without limit.

This duʿāʾ is part of the *Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a growing chain of heartfelt duʿāʾs shared by countless believers like you, worldwide.

And because in an authentic hadith reported by Muʿādh ibn Anas (ra), Rasulullah ﷺ encouraged us to share beneficial knowledge, I humbly ask that you please forward this message far and wide — it only takes a few seconds, and your sharing can start a chain of duʿāʾs that continue returning to you from everyone it reaches.

When you share this message, you’re not simply sharing a duʿāʾ. You’re opening the door to countless people making sincere duʿāʾ for you daily — with the Malaika (Angels) themselves saying *“Ameen”* to every single one.

I make duʿāʾ that Allah accepts it from you, and reward you for all those it reaches through you.

*Ameen.*`;
