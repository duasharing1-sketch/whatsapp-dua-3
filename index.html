This powerful dua calls upon Allah ﷻ — by His Names Al-Hayy (The Ever-Living) and Al-Qayyūm (The Self-Sustaining) — to transform every sin from our past, present, and future into abundant good deeds, magnified beyond measure by His infinite mercy. Because with His mercy, every mistake can become a source of blessing.

As Allah ﷻ says in the Noble Qur’an:

“Except for those who repent, believe and do righteous work. For them Allah will replace their evil deeds with good. And ever is Allah Forgiving and Merciful.”
(Surah Al-Furqan 25:70)

*Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Hayy (O Ever-Living), Ya Qayyum (O Self-Sustaining), Bi-Rahmatika (By Your Mercy), we ask of You a special forgiveness that transforms every one of our sins from past, present and future into abundant Ḥasanāt (good deeds). And have those Ḥasanāt magnified and enlarged infinitely without limit.*

This dua is part of *The Supplication of Infinite Blessings* — a powerful collection of heartfelt supplications designed to benefit you in both this life and the next. 

*At Dua Sharing, our mission is simple*: 

To encourage sincere dua, meaningful sharing, and to multiply blessings through a growing global chain of people making dua for one another every single day.

As Rasulullah ﷺ said: 

“The supplication of a Muslim for his brother in his absence will certainly be answered. Every time he makes a supplication for good for his brother, the angel appointed for this task says: ‘Ameen! And may it be for you too.”

Every post we share is taken directly from the full Supplication of Infinite Blessings — with the aim of moving hearts, inspiring action, and reminding us all of what truly matters.

When you share this post, you’re not simply sharing a dua. You’re opening the door to millions of people making sincere dua for you — with the Malaika (Angels) themselves saying “Ameen” to every single one.

May Allah accept it from you, and from everyone it reaches through you.

Ameen`;
